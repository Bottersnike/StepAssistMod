Uphill Step Assist is a mod that simply allows you to step up blocks smoothly, as apposed to Auto-Jump which makes you jump up blocks. The number of blocks you can step up can be configured in the mods menu (with a maximum of 32.5) and if you want to turn off the step assist, just set the value to "0.5" (0.5 is needed to allow you to walk up slabs).

**Be sure to turn off Auto-Jump in controls!!**
